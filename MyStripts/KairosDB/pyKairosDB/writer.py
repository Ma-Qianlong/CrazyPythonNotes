"""
KairosDB expects a list of objects per this::

    [{
        "name": "archive.file.tracked",
        "timestamp": 1349109376,
        "value": 123,
        "tags":{"host":"test"}
    },
    {
        "name": "archive.file.search",
        "timestamp": 999,
        "value": 321,
        "tags":{"host":"test"}
    }]


The documentation for this is at https://code.google.com/p/kairosdb/wiki/PushingData

We send this via the reuests object that the KairosDBConnection presents.
